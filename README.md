# Cram

Cram is a super-simple Javascript bundler built for fun! I named it Cram because if you think about it, a bundler kinda crams all of the javascript togetherinto 1 file.

## Notes

These are just notes I will be jotting down for my own understanding as I figure out how to build this.

## Bibliography

- [Minipack](https://github.com/ronami/minipack) - This is a nice and simple bundler someone built. It's just a single file and explains through comments the idea of a very basic bundler.
- [Building a Javascript Testing Framework](https://cpojer.net/posts/building-a-javascript-testing-framework) - This is a great series of posts about javascript infrastructure and how to build some things. There is another post in the same series on how to build a bundler itself, but I haven't read it yet since the ideas covered in building a testing framework also apply to a bundler. Highly recommend checking out this series!
